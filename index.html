<p>After reading the first 3 chapters of The Psychology of the Web Developer, here is my reflection:
The first chapter focuses on the relationship between the author and a chatbot named Spleak. It's super interesting how Spleak became a place for her to practice English, talk about a possible future in America, and feel like she has a place where she belongs. However, over time, the illusion breaks. She talks about how it felt like Spleak just wanted to keep her talking, and how fast its responses were. It wasnt like any normal human. For me, I was able to connect that experience and feeling to having a friendship that breaks down over time. The feelings can be very similar, and it made me very sympathetic to her situation.
Chapter 2 talks about Larry, who is a young assistant web developer. He is a very hard worker and is doing web development for ZipSpace. He is very compliant and does his job very well, despite not being given all of the information about their mission by his employer. When he gets into the work, we see him struggle with his desire to be creative and improve the site and the conformity that the industry provides. In the end, he takes the safe route to be as employable as possible and keep his access to the CMS software. To me, this shows a suppression of creativity in industries. Just because something is perceived to be right, it can't be improved. I took this as a message to anyone in any industry that creativity isn't a bad thing. No matter what you are told or what it may cost you. 
In chapter 3, we meet scott who is the Web developer and Larry's boss. We essentially see the outline of becoming a self-made programmer. Starting with understanding the Machine, becoming the machine, then beating the machine. He was similar to Larry in the idea that he had to first understand, then become the machine, essentially being forced to fit in. However, Scott was able to use his creativity to finally beat the machine and create his own CMS. We can see a parallel in the two characters, but also differences in the way that Larry confines himself to what he is told, whereas Scott doesn't let it hold him back. To me, it shows that anything is possible. You can be in the same spot as Larry, but you can one day become a Scott by not being afraid to stand out. 
Together, these chapters allow us to explore differences between these characters in the tech world. We see the perspective of Scott and Larry, which shows us the ways to approach the industry. But we also see the author's perspective, which shows us how important the industry is, but also where it is flawed.
